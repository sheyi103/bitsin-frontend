          pre-negotiated terms Please note that we are not responsible for remitting tax
          to relevant tax bodies as hotel suppliers will invoice Bitsin for the tax amount
          and hotel suppliers will hand over taxes applicable to relevant bodies. Areas
          and locations have their different tax rates and in paying tax amounts, there
          could be slight differences in tax recovery amount based on taxability and
          rates. Hotels may attract different service fees based on hotel type and amount.
          You should be able to confirm reservation changes where you fail to turn up, and
          must do so in not more than 24hrs or face the risk of having your reservation
          cancelled, as cancellation policy periods differ for various hotels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where you choose to cancel or alter your prepaid hotel reservation, you might be
          charged for such changes subject to the rules of the hotels for such changes and
          agree to pay for such changes as may occur. Once your hotel reservation request
          (s) have been lodged, you authorize Bitsin to make hotel reservations on your
          behalf based on the room rates displayed on the website and on the availability
          of reservations, which will include payment arrangements, services fees, and tax
          recovery charges. You are mandated to make back payments for early checkouts or
          no-shows within days after checking out.
